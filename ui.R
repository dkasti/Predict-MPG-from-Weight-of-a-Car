       This app is based on the mtcars data extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and
       comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).
       In this app a user can input various values of weight for a car ranging from 1000 lbs to 6000 lbs by sliding the slidebar below. Then, the app
       gives the predicted values for miles per gallon of the car based on three models: linear, quadratic and cubic. The app
       also shows the fitting curves for each of these models in the mtcars data set, which a user can hide, if one wants, by
       unchecking the checkboxes below."),
